## ABSTRACT SPACE

ont:Top rdfs:comment """ABSTRACT SPACES:

These are contexts within which entities and are located and tracked. Spatial metaphors are ubiquitous in natural language, and arguably in human cognition generally. Note for example prepositional phrases in English.

Each space is defined relative to some entity which serves as the frame of reference for that space. Generally speaking:
- regions in a space correspond to collections of individuals
- locations in a space correspond to individual entities located in regions within that space
- paths in a space extend from a 'source' to a 'target'
- the role of 'theme' traces movement of some entity along a path in one or more spaces

Other spatial elements may include 'magnitudes' measure using 'units of measure', and 'qualities' which name regions in a space which may be hard to quantify, but may be 'near' or 'far' from other qualities.

There's a lot of latitude for domain-specificity of the operative spatial metaphor for any given space, e.g. there may be a space of 'posession' relative to property laws for some government where regions within that space correspond to the property of some individual and individual posessions are located within those regions.

A relationship is a basic primitive typically expressed by sentences or clauses in natural language, integrating several 'participant' entities into a pattern typically named by a verb.

At the top-level there are two types of primitive relationships defined: 'states', which define static relationships between participants, and 'observations', which posit a subjective experience by some presumed observer of a situation.

Properties in the range of relationships may be called 'roles', and when they range over entities, those entities are called 'participants'. When a role ranges over another relationship that relationship is called a 'complement'.

## RELATIONSHIP / OBSERVATION

ont:Top rdfs:comment """RELATIONSHIP -- OBSERVATIONS:

One assumption we're making here is that ultimately any claim that can be made about the world can be described as an observation made by some (possibly implicit) observer. Our representation of an observication presumes a process that proceeds approximately as follows:

- The observer is presented with some _stimulus_
- Which leads to an _impression_
- Upon which a _figure/ground_ relationship is imposed
- Figures may be _primary figures_ ("trajctors") or _secondary figures_ ("landmarks")
- Figures are classified, bringing the observer in touch with previous experiences of other instances of that class
- Figures are _assessed_, (often_qualified_ or _quantified_) within some _scope_

The description above implies a sequential process, but as I understand it, in actual cognition these are aspects of the perceptual process that coalesce in parallel as a coherent whole.

Many of these elements may be implicit, but it's hard to imagine an observation that does not at least have a primary figure and some kind of classification and assessment. Indeed, the observation itself may often be left implicit for any particular relationship we want to assert. Nevertheless, we should bear in mind that such relationships
should align with the process of observation described here.

Note that not all observations are simple and immediate. We could represent the US Census of 2020 as a set of observations, quantifying the number of people living in a number of regions throughout the United States. We might represent each piece of documentation informing the census using sub-properties of `impression`, with the actual population estimates using sub-properties of `quantified as`.
