    dc:description "Vocabulary to describe the intentions of intentional agents." ;
    rdfs:comment "This includes an abstract space dedicated to intension, paths within which describe attraction and repulsion towards or away from various potentialities. This is the basis of discussing things like goals, plans and purposes." ;
    rdfs:comment "Modality is important here, as many of the things we may plan for or against are potentially true rather than actually true. A plan would typically exist in the region known as Speculative or Potential, and the actual execution of that plan may be recorded and compared to the plan." ;
